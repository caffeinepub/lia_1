  "summary": "Diff implements a guarded TTS auto-speak flow that avoids speaking on history restore and cancels prior speech when new assistant text is spoken, plus adds a Settings warning when Speech Synthesis is unsupported. One additional behavior (auto-selecting a preferred Hindi/female voice) appears to be introduced without being requested in this BuildRequest.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Auto-select a Hindi/female-preferred voice on voice load (including specific name matching like 'lekha'/'nicky') and persist it to settings.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks to fix reliable TTS triggering (no speaking on history restore) and to show an unsupported-browser message in Settings; it does not request changes to voice auto-selection heuristics or auto-persistence behavior.",
